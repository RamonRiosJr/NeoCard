## ⚡ Frontend Bundle Bloat: @google/genai SDK Included in Client Build

### Problem Statement

The `@google/genai` SDK is listed as a **production `dependency`** and bundled directly into the client-side JavaScript output. For a digital business card — a UI that must load instantly — this is a critical performance anti-pattern.

**Measured Impact:**

- Current gzipped bundle: ~76 kB
- `@google/genai` SDK contribution: ~180–220 kB (uncompressed)
- This degrades **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)** and **Time to Interactive (TTI)**, both key Google Lighthouse metrics

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `@google/genai` uninstalled from `dependencies`
- [ ] Client bundle no longer imports anything from `@google/genai`
- [ ] `geminiService.ts` replaced with a thin `fetch()` call to `/api/chat`
- [ ] Lighthouse Performance score improves by ≥ 10 points post-fix
- [ ] Bundle size diff committed as evidence (before/after screenshot in PR)

### Dependency
>
> ⚠️ **Blocked by SEC-001.** This issue is automatically resolved when the serverless proxy pattern is implemented.

### Technical Notes

Remove SDK from client and replace with a simple fetch:

```ts
// src/services/geminiService.ts (after fix)
export const chatWithAvatar = async (userMessage: string): Promise<string> => {
  const res = await fetch('/api/chat', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ userMessage }),
  });
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Chat service unavailable');
  const data = await res.json();
  return data.response;
};
```
