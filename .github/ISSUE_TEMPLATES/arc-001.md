## ✅ RESOLVED — PWA Implementation Completed

### Problem Statement

The `README.md` and `metadata.json` claimed the app was "Installable as a Progressive Web App for offline access." This was **false**. There was no `manifest.json`, no service worker, and no pre-caching strategy — constituting misleading documentation.

### Resolution Summary

Implemented full PWA support via `vite-plugin-pwa`:

- ✅ `vite-plugin-pwa` installed and configured in `vite.config.ts`
- ✅ Web App Manifest (`manifest.webmanifest`) created with correct icon paths, `display: standalone`, and proper `theme_color`
- ✅ Service Worker registered with `registerType: 'autoUpdate'` (Workbox strategy)
- ✅ `index.html` updated with `<link rel="manifest">`, `<meta name="theme-color">`, and `<link rel="apple-touch-icon">`
- ✅ App is now installable on Android Chrome and iOS Safari

### Verification

Lighthouse PWA audit: **Installable ✓ | PWA Optimized ✓**
