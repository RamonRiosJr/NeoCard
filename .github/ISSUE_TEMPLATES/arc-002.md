## ✅ RESOLVED — App.tsx Successfully Decomposed into Isolated Components

### Problem Statement

`App.tsx` was a 330+ line monolith containing inline component definitions (`LeadFormModal`, `QRModal`, `SocialIcon`), business logic, state management, and JSX — all in a single file. This violated React's separation of concerns principle and made the codebase impossible to test or maintain independently.

### Resolution Summary

Extracted and isolated all embedded components into dedicated files:

| Extracted Component | New File | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `LeadFormModal` | `src/components/LeadFormModal.tsx` | Contact form modal with ARIA |
| `QRModal` | `src/components/QRModal.tsx` | QR code display overlay |
| `SocialIcon` | `src/components/SocialIcon.tsx` | Accessible social media link |

**Result:** `App.tsx` reduced to ~200 lines of pure orchestration logic with clean import boundaries.

### Verification

- Each component has explicit TypeScript `Props` interface
- Components are individually importable and testable in isolation
- `npm run build` and `npm run typecheck` pass with 0 errors

### Commit

Resolved in commit `refactor(components): extract LeadFormModal, QRModal, SocialIcon from App.tsx`
