## ✅ RESOLVED — Accessibility Violations Remediated

### Problem Statement

Icon-only interactive elements (social links, close buttons, QR trigger) had no `aria-label` attributes. Modals had no `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal`, or `aria-labelledby` — making the app unusable for screen reader users and failing WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.

**Violations identified:**

- 8+ icon-only buttons with no accessible name
- 3 modal overlays with no ARIA roles
- No focus management on modal open/close

### Resolution Summary

- ✅ `aria-label` added to all icon-only buttons (social icons, close, QR, chat)
- ✅ All modals decorated with `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, `aria-labelledby`
- ✅ `SocialIcon` component has `aria-label` derived from platform name
- ✅ Profile image has descriptive `alt` text

### Verification

axe-core DevTools: **0 critical violations** on primary card view and all modals.

### Affected Components

- `src/components/LeadFormModal.tsx`
- `src/components/QRModal.tsx`
- `src/components/SocialIcon.tsx`
- `src/components/AvatarChat.tsx`
